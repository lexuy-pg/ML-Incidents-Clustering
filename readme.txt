Welcome to the 
Incident Clustering Analysis Tool!

What's new?

With the development of a new front-end interface, 
users no longer have to directly interact with the codebase to run the model as the app now offers a more user-friendly interface, 
facilitating the transition from a technical notebook to a user-oriented experience.

Reminders for installation & running the model

1. Make sure to $ pip install -r requirements.txt
